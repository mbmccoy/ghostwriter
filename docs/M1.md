# Getting this running on an M1 mac

Yes, I'm trying to install this on an M1 Mac using the `nix` package manager. No,
this is likely going to fail. Yes, I'm still going to try.

## Nix packages
Here's my Nix environment:
```bash
$ nix-env -q

cmake-3.18.4
ffmpeg-4.3.1
freetype-2.10.4
libjpeg-9d
libpng-1.2.59
nix-2.3.9
nss-cacert-3.49.2
opencv-4.3.0
zlib-1.2.11
```

## Installing

### Pillow

Pillow doesn't really want to install, so we just do force disable zlib and jpeg support: 
```bash
pip3 install pillow --global-option="build_ext" --global-option="--disable-zlib" --global-option="--disable-jpeg"
```

### Finishing up
Run `make requirements-ci` after the above.
